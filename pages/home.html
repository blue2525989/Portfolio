		My name is Jason Bierbrauer and this is my web portfolio. I have been searching 
		for my passion for a long time and have finally found it in writing code.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I am seeking out a career as a junior developer at the moment. I have a strong desire 
		to learn and I am driven to succeed. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Linux is my operation system of choice and I enjoy working from the terminal. The level of 
		control offered is immense, especially when writing scripts to automate tasks.

		Check out my Projects Page to see my modus operandi! There are several Java Spring Boot 
		web applications as well as details on this Single Page Application written in AngularJS. 
		Not to mention some standalone applications written in Java with the Java Swing package that 
		perform various tasks like interacting with MySQL or running text files through ciphers!
