		<h3>Technology interests</h3>
		<small id="fileHelp" class="form-text text-muted blue-spa-small">
		Java, Spring, Web applications, AngularJS, Linux 
		</small>
		<p>
			I have been learning Java for over a year now and have a deep interest in web based technologies
		such as Spring Boot coupled with Spring Security. Now that I have been building web applications for 
		some time I realize the need for a responsive front end and have been honing my AngularJS skills. My 
		next project I plan to build will have AngularJS for a front end and Spring Boot for the back end.
		<br/><br/>
			Linux is my operation of choice. I enjoy working from the terminal and find it much easier now 
		that I have been using it for some time. I have dabbled in writing small scripts in the Bash scripting 
		language.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Fun time activities</h3>
		<small id="fileHelp" class="form-text text-muted blue-spa-small">
		Hiking, Canoeing, Organic vegetable gardening, Hobby farming, Motorcycles
		</small>
		<p>
			Family time every weekend almost always consists of outdoor activities whether it is hiking 
		beautiful trails in some of Missouri's wonderful state parks or canoeing down the Meremac river to 
		playing with our goats on our small hobby farm. 
		<br/><br/>
			I also enjoy riding my motorcycle on rural country roads. I like the back roads because there are 
		a lot less other vehicles on the road which means less chances of being hit by drivers on their cell phones! 
		I just enjoy cruising and taking in the beautiful scenery.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Life goals</h3>
		<small id="fileHelp" class="form-text text-muted blue-spa-small">
		Software developer career, Growing my family, Happy life
		</small>
		<p>
			I am fully dedicated to changing my career from construction to a full fledged software developer. 
		Currently I am a stay at home father and help with my wife's side businesses. I keep a tight schedule 
		and wake up early to finish my chores so I can then spend the rest of the day reading and writing new 
		code.<br/><br/>
			I am newly married and so happy to have my amazing partner come in to my daughter and I's life. 
		Since the first day I saw her I knew I would marry her and here we are, happy as can be years later. 
		Having a great work life balance is important to me.
