		This application started off as a fun game from Launch Codes LC 101 class where the instructor 
		asked us to come with our best idea for a game (in Python) by the end of class. I decided to 
		make Blackjack because I was familiar with the rules of the game. 
		<br/><br/>
		Later the following weekend I decided to rewrite the game in Java and give it a user interface 
		using the Java Swing package. I went more in depth with the rules of the game and tried to cover 
		them all. There is a score board that keeps track of combo's and I made the cards deal randomly adding 
		and removing them from an array list.
		<br/><br/>
		Once finished with Blackjack I wanted to add poker. I extended the Card class and added some poker 
		specific features. Next I put together a slightly different interface with the Swing package. The deck 
		in this game is not dealt randomly but is an actual 52 Card array list.
