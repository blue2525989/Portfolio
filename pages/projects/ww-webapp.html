		<p>
		Wandering Wonderland.com is another one of my wife's businesses. This application was built 
		to serve as a compliment to the eBay store and a place to store some of her my favorite items. 
		<br/><br/>
		Spring Boot is used for an easy deployment to AWS hosting. Spring Security is also used 
		giving the user an administration level account which allows for editing for the majority of 
		site content.
		<br/><br/>
		Using the AWS SDK, new images of items can be uploaded easily to the S3 storage buckets. 
		This is the first application where I was able to make the upload work correctly and was extremely 
		proud of myself for doing so.
		<br/><br/>
		Also using the AWS SDK I was able to implement the SES email service to allow customer to email us 
		about potential items they may want to purchase.
		<br/><br/>
		Thymeleaf is used as a rendering engine. It is easy to work with and replaces some of the 
		verbose language of a JSP page.
		<br/><br/>
		MySQL handles multiple tables that hold data to be presented in each view.
