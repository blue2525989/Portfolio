		<p>
		This is the first application I made that dealt with databases. I started with 
		the idea of building a central database of preschools and daycares that I would then in 
		turn build a web application around and hopefully profit from by advertising.
		<br/><br/>
		I started with building a simple user interface with Java Swing package where I could 
		enter SQL commands and had a direct connection established. It soon turned into a multi-view 
		application where a user can connect to any specific database and table and then cycle through 
		entering SQL statements as needed.
		<br/><br/>
		There is also a view where the user can connect and then create new databases or delete them. 
		On this same view there is the option of entering a SQL statement to create tables or delete them.
