		<p>
		This program is a fun application that allows the opening and encrypting of any text file 
		using any of three different ciphers that allow optional parameter overloading. It came to be 
		because I was converting the caesar and vigenere cipher from Python to Java. I ended up spending 
		the entire day rewriting them to be more concise and various overloaded versions. 
		<br/><br/>
		Once I was finished I started thinking of how I could use these methods I spent all day on in 
		a actual application. 
		I then decided to whip up a user interface using the Java Swing package and added a JFileChoose to the 
		menu bar to allow for using opening/saving of text files.
