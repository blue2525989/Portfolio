		<p>
		Ticking Toy Bomb is a upcycled jewelry business that my wife created years ago. 
		I decided to build the online presence for it to try and understand what a small business 
		web application might need. I am a entrepreneur myself and would like to someday build 
		applications for people in my free time, similar to how I obtained side work frequently 
		in my previous career.
		<br/><br/>
		This application relies heavily on the Spring Boot framework to handle routing and all server 
		side request. Spring Security is also used to allow for a administration level account. This 
		administration account lets the admin log in from the live deployment and edit almost all 
		of the content on the site.
		<br/><br/>
		Everything from the page title, icon, meta description and keywords to every image and word content 
		and every page can be customized. The administration side of the site also allows the user 
		to change their account name and password on the fly by opening and sending a SQL query directly 
		to the database.
		<br/><br/>
		The AWS SDK is used for uploading image files directly to the S3 storage bucket. The admin is given 
		the option of creating new or selecting an image type which corresponds to creating or selecting a 
		specific folder within the bucket to save the file too.
		<br/><br/>
		Also the AWS SDK is used to set up SES email service to visitors could reach out and contact 
		me with any questions or leads for potential career opportunities.
		<br/><br/>
		MySQL is used to handle 13 separate tables that hold all the view information and Security tables. 
		Each view in the 'non admin view' typically comprises 4-5 tables with specific data to render.
		<br/><br/>
		Thymeleaf is used as a rendering engine. It is easy to work with and replaces some of the 
		verbose language of a JSP page.
