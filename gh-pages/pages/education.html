		<h3>Launch Code boot camp</h3>
		<p>
		I have most recently completed Lanuch Code's LC101 six month coding boot camp. The 
		program is broken down into three units, an introduction to basic skills, next an 
		introduction to building applications for the web and the MVC concept, and lastly 
		a skill track is chosen and then we build web applications in the chosen language.
		<br/><br/>
		The first unit is taught in Python and features an introduction to basic programming 
		concepts. Throughout the unit we build simple applications that teach the concepts of 
		collections and object oriented design.
		<br/><br/>
		Next we dove into the concepts of coding for the web with building applications in 
		Python with the google app engine as a container/server. This is where we started to 
		learn the concepts of Model View and Control design. This was great because I was learning 
		Spring in my free time and was able to take this home and apply it to my personal project.
		<br/><br/>
		Lastly we were given the option of a specific skill track to choose, either Java or C#, I chose 
		Java because I already had four months of self learning invested in it. We were introduced to 
		the Spring Boot framework as well as Thymeleaf for rendering the views and MySQL to persist 
		all of the data.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Self-instruction</h3>
		<p>
		I started to code because my daughter and I moved in with my girlfriend an hour away from our current 
		home and I could not find a online database of preschools, so I decided to make one myself. We then went 
		to a local used book store where I bought three books on Java for under $10. I worked through 
		the first book 'Sam's Teach yourself Java in 24 hours' in 2 weeks and quickly fell in love with 
		coding. <br/><br/>
		I frequently search book stores for cheap books to work through and add to my collection. This 
		is my preferred method of learning, even though it is much easier to find knowledge on google. 
		<br/><br/>
		I really enjoy web applications and spend time researching the Spring framework. I like the 
		simplicity of Spring when building back end applications. For the front end, I am interested in 
		learning AngularJS. Angular offers lighting face user interfaces which will keep my visitor happy. 
		I am currently working on meshing the two technologies together to build a true 'Full stack' web application.
